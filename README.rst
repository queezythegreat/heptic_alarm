Heptic Alarm Clock


The *Heptic Alarm Clock* is intended to be arm straped alarm clock that will wake a heavy sleeper. Instead
of just using sound, the alarm with use vibrations to wake the person up. The device is intended to be
used as a strap on device (either to the leg or arm) or as a bedside clock.

Using a 6 degree of freedom sensor the alarm will also be able to detect the sleeping cycle of the wearer,
and start the wakup process at the end of the REM cycle. This should increase the effectiveness of the 
alarm.
